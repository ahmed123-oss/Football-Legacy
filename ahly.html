        <h2>History of Al Ahly FC</h2>
        <p>The Foundation of Al Ahly SC (1907)
            Al Ahly Sporting Club was founded on April 24, 1907, by a group of prominent Egyptian nationalists led by Omar Lotfi Bey. <br> The club's main goal was to provide a space for young Egyptian patriots to meet and practice sports during the nationalist movement against British colonial rule. The name "Al Ahly" translates to "The National," symbolizing its strong connection to the Egyptian people.<br>
            
            First Chairman: <br>The club’s first president was an Englishman, Mitchel Ince, who was chosen for his expertise in sports administration. However, Egyptian presidents, starting with Abdel Khalek Tharwat, took over leadership in the years that followed.
