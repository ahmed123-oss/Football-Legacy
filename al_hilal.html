        <p>
            Karim Ahmed
The History of Al-Hilal Saudi Football Club (1957–2025)

Al-Hilal Saudi Football Club, one of the most successful football teams in Asia and a giant of Saudi Arabian football, boasts a rich history marked by domestic dominance and continental success. Founded in 1957, Al-Hilal has grown from humble beginnings into a powerhouse, both in the Saudi Professional League (SPL) and on the international stage.

Founding and Early Years (1957–1960s)

Al-Hilal was founded on October 16, 1957, by Sheikh Abdul Rahman bin Saad Al Saad. Originally named “Olympic Club,” the team was renamed “Al-Hilal” by a royal decree from King Saud, making it the first Saudi football team to receive royal patronage. The name “Al-Hilal,” meaning “The Crescent,” reflects the team’s ambition to rise and shine like the moon crescent.

During its early years, the club focused on establishing itself in the Saudi football landscape. Though they faced strong competition from well-established teams, Al-Hilal quickly developed a reputation for skill and determination.

Emergence as a Domestic Force (1970s–1980s)

The 1970s marked the beginning of Al-Hilal’s rise as a dominant force in Saudi football. In 1977, the team won its first Saudi Professional League title, setting the stage for a golden era. Throughout the 1980s, Al-Hilal added more league titles and domestic cups to their cabinet, with standout players like Sami Al-Jaber, Majed Abdullah, and Yousuf Al-Thunayan leading the way.

In 1986, Al-Hilal achieved another milestone by winning its first King’s Cup, a prestigious domestic tournament, solidifying its status as a leading club in Saudi Arabia.

International Breakthrough (1990s)

The 1990s marked Al-Hilal’s emergence on the continental stage. In 1991, the team won its first AFC Champions League title, becoming the first Saudi club to achieve this honor. This victory signified Al-Hilal’s growing stature in Asian football and began a legacy of international success.

Al-Hilal also claimed multiple Crown Prince Cups during this decade, alongside maintaining its dominance in the SPL. The 1990s saw the club attract foreign talent and establish a strong youth academy, which produced many of Saudi Arabia’s finest players.

The New Millennium: Domestic and Asian Dominance (2000–2010)

In the early 2000s, Al-Hilal reinforced its reputation as the “Leader of Asia” with consistent performances at the domestic and international levels. The club won numerous Saudi Professional League titles and several Crown Prince Cups during this period. The development of homegrown stars, like Nawaf Al-Temyat and Mohammed Al-Deayea, further solidified their dominance.

In 2000, Al-Hilal added another AFC Champions League trophy to their collection, followed by a historic win in the Asian Super Cup. By this time, the team was firmly established as a continental giant, with a growing fanbase across Asia and the Middle East.

The Golden Era (2010–2025)

Al-Hilal entered a golden era during the 2010s, winning several domestic league titles and becoming a dominant force in the AFC Champions League. The team’s performances were characterized by a blend of experienced players and rising stars, along with high-profile international signings.
	•	2019: Al-Hilal won its third AFC Champions League title after defeating Urawa Red Diamonds in the final. This triumph solidified their position as the most successful club in Asian football history.
	•	2021: The team repeated this feat by winning its fourth AFC Champions League title, further enhancing its reputation.

Al-Hilal also became known for its involvement in the FIFA Club World Cup, where it represented Asia multiple times and achieved notable performances against some of the world’s top teams.

	•	AFC Champions League: The team has won the prestigious title four times, a record in Asian football.
