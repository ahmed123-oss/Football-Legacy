        <h2>History of Liverpool</h2>
        <p>
            The Foundation (1892)
Liverpool Football Club was founded on June 3, 1892, after a dispute between John Houlding, the owner of Anfield, and Everton FC's management led to Everton vacating the ground.

Houlding formed Liverpool FC to occupy Anfield, initially naming it “Everton Athletic”, but later changing it to Liverpool FC.
Liverpool joined the Football League Second Division in 1893 and won promotion in their debut season.
Early Success (1900s–1940s)
Liverpool won their first Football League title in 1901, marking the beginning of their rise.
By 1923, the club had won four league titles, becoming a dominant force in English football.
During World War II, football was interrupted, but Liverpool remained one of England’s top clubs.
The Shankly Revolution (1959–1974)
In 1959, Bill Shankly became manager, transforming Liverpool into a global powerhouse:
Introduced a legendary boot room culture.
Secured promotion to the First Division in 1962.
Won three league titles (1964, 1966, 1973) and the UEFA Cup in 1973.
Shankly's philosophy and passion laid the foundation for Liverpool's dominance in the 1970s and 1980s.
Golden Era of European Glory (1970s–1980s)
Under the leadership of managers like Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan, Liverpool became one of the greatest clubs in European football:

6 English league titles between 1976 and 1986.
4 European Cups (1977, 1978, 1981, 1984), establishing Liverpool as a European giant.
Key players like Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush, and Graeme Souness became club legends.
Tragedy struck during the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, leading to a ban on English clubs in European competitions.
The Hillsborough Disaster (1989)
The Hillsborough tragedy during an FA Cup semi-final in 1989 resulted in the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans. This deeply affected the club and its fanbase, leading to decades-long campaigns for justice.

Decline and Revival (1990s–2000s)
Liverpool struggled to replicate their dominance during the Premier League era.
Highlight moments included winning the UEFA Cup (2001) and the FA Cup (2006) under Gérard Houllier and Rafael Benítez, respectively.
2005: Liverpool staged a miraculous comeback in the Champions League final, defeating AC Milan after being 3-0 down, earning their fifth European Cup.
The Klopp Era (2015–2025)
In 2015, Jürgen Klopp took over as manager, ushering in a new golden era for Liverpool:
2019: Liverpool won their sixth Champions League title, defeating Tottenham Hotspur.
2020: The club ended a 30-year wait for a league title by winning the Premier League with a record 99 points.
Klopp emphasized high-pressing, attacking football, with stars like Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané, Virgil van Dijk, and Alisson Becker leading the charge.
2022–2025: Liverpool remained competitive in domestic and European competitions, continuing to challenge for major trophies.
