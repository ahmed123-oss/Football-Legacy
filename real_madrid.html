        <h2>History of Real Madrid</h2>
    <p>The Foundation (1902)
        Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, commonly known as Real Madrid, was officially established on March 6, 1902, by a group of football enthusiasts in Madrid, led by the Padrós brothers, Juan and Carlos Padrós. The club was initially called Madrid Football Club.
        
        In 1920, King Alfonso XIII granted the club the title "Real" (Royal), adding the crown to its emblem.
        From its early years, Real Madrid focused on excellence and became a symbol of Spanish pride.
        Early Success and the Formation of La Liga (1920s–1940s)
        1929: Real Madrid became a founding member of La Liga and was among the top competitors from the beginning.
        The club won its first La Liga title in 1932, followed by another in 1933.
        During the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), football activity in Spain was severely disrupted, but Real Madrid remained resilient.
        The Di Stéfano Era: Dominance Begins (1950s)
        The arrival of Alfredo Di Stéfano in 1953 marked the beginning of an unparalleled era of dominance:
        
        Under the leadership of Di Stéfano and coach Miguel Muñoz, Real Madrid won five consecutive European Cups (1956–1960), cementing its status as a global powerhouse.
        The team also dominated domestically, securing multiple La Liga titles during this golden era.
        1970s–1980s: Building a Legacy
        Real Madrid continued to dominate Spanish football, winning several La Liga and Copa del Rey titles.
        1980s: The emergence of the famous "La Quinta del Buitre" (The Vulture's Cohort), led by Emilio Butragueño, brought renewed success. The team won five consecutive La Liga titles from 1986 to 1990.
        The Galácticos Era (2000–2006)
        In the early 2000s, under president Florentino Pérez, the club adopted the "Galácticos" policy, signing world-class players like Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo, Ronaldo Nazário, and David Beckham.
        Major achievements:
        UEFA Champions League: 2002 (with Zidane's iconic volley in the final).
        La Liga titles: Multiple during this period.
        Despite criticism of overspending, this era significantly boosted Real Madrid’s global appeal.
        The Zidane and Ronaldo Era (2010–2018)
        The signing of Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009 was a turning point for the club, marking a decade of dominance:
        Real Madrid won 4 Champions League titles in 5 years (2014, 2016, 2017, 2018) under coach Zinedine Zidane.
        Ronaldo became the club’s all-time top scorer with 450 goals.
        This era also included:
        Multiple La Liga titles.
        Success in the FIFA Club World Cup, further solidifying its status as the greatest club in the world.
        Recent Years and Continued Success (2019–2025)
        After Ronaldo's departure in 2018, Real Madrid faced challenges but quickly rebounded:
        2022: Real Madrid won their 14th Champions League title, defeating Liverpool in the final.
        The team focused on young talents like Vinícius Jr., Rodrygo, and Eduardo Camavinga, complemented by veterans like Karim Benzema and Luka Modrić.
        Real Madrid maintained its dominance in La Liga and continued to expand its fan base globally.
        Trophies and Achievements (As of 2025)
        UEFA Champions League titles: 14 (record).
        La Liga titles: 35 (record).
        Copa del Rey titles: 20+.
        FIFA Club World Cups: 5+ (record).
