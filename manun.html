        <h2>History of Manchester United</h2>
        <p>The Foundation (1878)
            Manchester United was originally founded in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by workers from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.
            
            The club adopted the name Manchester United in 1902 after facing financial troubles and being rescued by local businessman John Henry Davies, who also changed the club's colors to the iconic red and white.
            Early Success (1900s–1940s)
            Manchester United won their first Football League title in 1908 and their first FA Cup in 1909 under manager Ernest Mangnall.
            The club struggled financially and on the pitch during the interwar period but remained a staple of English football.
            The Busby Era and the Munich Air Disaster (1945–1969)
            1945: Sir Matt Busby was appointed manager, revolutionizing the club with his focus on youth development and attacking football.
            1956–1957: The "Busby Babes," a team of young and talented players, won back-to-back league titles.
            1958: Tragedy struck when the team suffered the Munich Air Disaster, which killed 23 people, including eight players. Despite the devastation, Busby rebuilt the team and instilled resilience in the club’s DNA.
            European Glory and Domestic Success
            1968: Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup, defeating Benfica 4-1, with stars like George Best, Bobby Charlton, and Denis Law leading the team.
            The late 1960s and 1970s saw fluctuating success, including relegation in 1974, but the club quickly bounced back to the top flight.
            The Ferguson Era: Dominance Redefined (1986–2013)
            1986: Sir Alex Ferguson was appointed manager, initiating the club's most successful era:
            1993: Manchester United won their first Premier League title (and first league title since 1967), starting a period of dominance.
            1999: United achieved an unprecedented treble: Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League.
            Ferguson’s teams were known for their attacking style, late comebacks, and iconic players like Ryan Giggs, Eric Cantona, Paul Scholes, and Cristiano Ronaldo.
            Ferguson retired in 2013, leaving behind a legacy of 13 Premier League titles, 2 Champions League trophies, and numerous domestic honors.
            Post-Ferguson Era (2013–2025)
            United struggled to replicate their dominance following Ferguson's retirement:
            Managers like David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, and Ole Gunnar Solskjær faced challenges in restoring glory.
            Despite struggles, the club won:
            2016 FA Cup under Van Gaal.
            2017 UEFA Europa League under Mourinho.
            2023–2025: Under manager Erik ten Hag, United focused on rebuilding and challenging for domestic and European honors, developing young talents and reinforcing their squad with strategic signings.
            Trophies and Achievements (As of 2025)
            English League titles: 20 (record shared with Liverpool).
            FA Cups: 12.
            UEFA Champions League titles: 3.
            League Cups: 6.
            FIFA Club World Cups: 2.
            Legacy
            Manchester United is one of the most iconic football clubs globally, known for its attacking philosophy, resilience, and massive global fan base. From the tragedy of Munich to the triumphs under Ferguson, the club embodies a spirit of never giving up and continually striving for greatness.
